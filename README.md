# R2M_IT_Research 

The goal of this repo is that we have a place to collect all the information that we gather during our research. Please be organized when adding new information. 

What is meant by collecting information. Any datasheets, relevant articles, links, etc that we find among the way should be kept here. It is your choice how to do it (LaTeX, .txt files. or Markdown, just be organized!!!)

## Workflow

As of now, everybody has editor privileges (everyone can merge, push to the main repo). Ideally you work on your own branch, and then when your work is revised, merge it with the main branch! I will open issues as soon as possible with more details on what you guys should do, and then you guys can commit changes to solve them!

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me at any time. The idea behind all this structure is that we work better together, so lets keep good contact between each other!!!
