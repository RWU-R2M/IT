# Install Python 3.8

To use the Python based ODrive tool, Python needs to be installed on your machine. Like recommended by ODrive, this guide sticks to Python version 3.8, as the ODrive software has been developed during that time. The latest and last patch version is version 3.8.20 and can be downloaded [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3820/)

> [!WARNING]
> As of 2024-10-07, 3.8 has reached the end-of-life phase of its release cycle. 3.8.20 was the final security release. The codebase for 3.8 is now frozen and no further updates will be provided nor issues of any kind will be accepted on the bug tracker.
